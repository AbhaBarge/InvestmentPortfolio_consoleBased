# MiniProject
Console Based Investment Portfolio as MiniProject
- This was our semester-end project (3rd semester) for the subject 'Data Structures'
- I, along with 2 other classmates created this console-based program.
- The project has a rudimentary approach towards stock trading/investment apps.
- This project focuses on the various data structures that can be used in such apps. 
- The program is written completely in Java and utilizes major data structures.
- We have covered the following data structures :
    - Graphs
    - Hash Table and Hash Function, using separate chaining to resolve collision.
    - Binary Search trees
    - Queue
    - Stack
    - LinkedList
    - Arrays and their sorting.
